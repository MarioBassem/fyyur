This web application is an implementation of one of the projects at Udacity's advanced web application nanodegree program.

It was a nice experience, and I learned alot.

Some of the stuff I got to do were:
 * Using SQLAlchemy for setting up normalized models for the objects supported in the app.
 * Implementing form submissions for creating new Venues, Artist, and Shows.
 * Implementing the controlleres for listing venues, artists, and shows.
 * Implementing search, powering the `/search` endpoints that serve the application's search functionalities.
 * Serve venue and artist detail pages, powering the `<venue|artist>/<id>` endpoints that power the detail page.

More features will be added over time.

Fyyur

## Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

Your job is to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.
